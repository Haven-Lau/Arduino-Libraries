/// \mainpage VirtualWire library for Arduino and other boards
///
/// This is the VirtualWire library.
///
/// \par END OF LIFE NOTICE
///
/// This VirtualWire library has now been superceded by the RadioHead 
/// library http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead
/// RadioHead and its RH_ASK driver provides all the features supported by VirtualWire, and much more
/// besides, including Reliable Datagrams, Addressing, Routing and Meshes. All the platforms that
/// VirtualWire supported are also supported by RadioHead.
///
/// This library will no longer be maintained or updated, but we will continue to publish
/// it for the benefit of the the community. Nevertheless we recommend upgrading to RadioHead where
/// possible.
///
/// VirtualWire is a library for Arduino, Maple and others that provides features to send short
/// messages, without addressing, retransmit or acknowledgment, a bit like UDP
/// over wireless, using ASK (amplitude shift keying). Supports a number of
/// inexpensive radio transmitters and receivers. All that is required is
/// transmit data, receive data and (for transmitters, optionally) a PTT
/// transmitter enable. Can also be used over various analog connections (not just a data radio), 
/// such as the audio channel of an A/V sender
///
/// It is intended to be compatible with the RF Monolithics (www.rfm.com)
/// Virtual Wire protocol, but this has not been tested.
///
/// Does not use the Arduino UART. Messages are sent with a training preamble,
/// message length and checksum. Messages are sent with 4-to-6 bit encoding
/// for good DC balance, and a CRC checksum for message integrity.
///
/// But why not just use a UART connected directly to the
/// transmitter/receiver? As discussed in the RFM documentation, ASK receivers
/// require a burst of training pulses to synchronize the transmitter and
/// receiver, and also requires good balance between 0s and 1s in the message
/// stream in order to maintain the DC balance of the message. UARTs do not
/// provide these. They work a bit with ASK wireless, but not as well as this
/// code.
///
/// This library provides classes for 
/// - VirtualWire: unaddressed, unreliable messages
///
/// Example Arduino programs are included to show the main modes of use.
///
/// The version of the package that this documentation refers to can be downloaded 
/// from http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/VirtualWire/VirtualWire-1.27.zip
/// You can find the latest version at http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/VirtualWire
///
/// You can also find online help and disussion at 
/// http://groups.google.com/group/virtualwire
/// Please use that group for all questions and discussions on this topic. 
/// Do not contact the author directly, unless it is to discuss commercial licensing.
/// Before asking a question or reporting a bug, please read http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html

/// \par Theory of operation
///
/// See ASH Transceiver Software Designer's Guide of 2002.08.07
///   http://www.rfm.com/products/apnotes/tr_swg05.pdf
///
/// \par Supported Hardware
///
/// A range of communications
/// hardware is supported. The ones listed below are available in common retail
/// outlets in Australia and other countries for under $10 per unit. Many
/// other modules may also work with this software. 
///
/// Runs on a wide range of Arduino processors using Arduino IDE 1.0 or later.
/// Also runs on on Energia
/// with MSP430G2553 / G2452 and Arduino with ATMega328 (courtesy Yannick DEVOS - XV4Y), 
/// but untested by us. It also runs on Teensy 3.0 and 3.1 (courtesy of Paul
/// Stoffregen) using the Arduino IDE 1.0.5 and the Teensyduino addon 1.18. 
/// Also compiles and runs on ATtiny85 in
/// Arduino environment, courtesy r4z0r7o3. Also compiles on maple-ide-v0.0.12,
/// and runs on Maple, flymaple 1.1 etc. Runs on ATmega8/168 (Arduino Diecimila,
/// Uno etc), ATmega328 and can run on almost any other AVR8 platform,
/// without relying on the Arduino framework, by properly configuring the
/// library using 'VirtualWire_Config.h' header file for describing the access
/// to IO pins and for setting up the timer. From version 1.22 the library can
/// be compiled by a C compiler (by renaming VirtualWire.cpp into
/// VirtualWire.c) and can be easily integrated with other IDEs like 'Atmel
/// Studio' for example (courtesy of Alexandru Mircescu).
///
/// - Receivers
///  - RX-B1 (433.92MHz) (also known as ST-RX04-ASK)
/// - Transmitters: 
///  - TX-C1 (433.92MHz)
/// - Transceivers
///  - DR3100 (433.92MHz)
///
/// For testing purposes you can connect 2 VirtualWire instances directly, by
/// connecting pin 12 of one to 11 of the other and vice versa, like this for a duplex connection:
///
/// <code>
/// <pre>
/// Arduino 1         wires         Arduino 1
///  D11-----------------------------D12
///  D12-----------------------------D11
///  GND-----------------------------GND
/// </pre>
/// </code>
///
/// You can also connect 2 VirtualWire instances over a suitable analog
/// transmitter/receiver, such as the audio channel of an A/V transmitter/receiver. You may need
/// buffers at each end of the connection to convert the 0-5V digital output to a suitable analog voltage.
///
/// Caution: ATTiny85 has only 2 timers, one (timer 0) usually used for
/// millis() and one (timer 1) for PWM analog outputs. The VirtualWire
/// library, when built for ATTiny85, takes over timer 0, which prevents use
/// of millis() etc but does permit analog outputs.
///
/// \par Installation
///
/// To install, unzip the library into the libraries sub-directory of your
/// Arduino application directory. Then launch the Arduino environment; you
/// should see the library in the Sketch->Import Library menu, and example
/// code in
/// File->Sketchbook->Examples->VirtualWire menu.
///
/// \par Donations

/// We try hard to keep it up to date, fix bugs
/// and to provide free support. If this library has helped you save time or money, please consider donating at
